Project Description: simple project to learn both flask and reading information from a .ini file.  The app first reads the server information from either 		     	    defualt.ini or the user given credentials.ini.  After the server is set it up it listens for requests.  If the server gets a request for
		     a file that it has, then it servers the file.  If the server does not have the requested file then the servers serves a 404 error, file no                     t found.  If the file request contains illegal characeters such as (.. or ~) then the server serves a 403 error, for illegal characters.
